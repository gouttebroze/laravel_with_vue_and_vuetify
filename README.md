# laravel_with_vue_and_vuetify
Incorporation of Vue.js, Vuetify.js'plugin and my own new @import .scss in "ressources" "sass" "app.scss" into a laravel project (to finish). I make that in order to perperate my last defense of my school year of web developper (University Telecom Saint-Etienne in France).
